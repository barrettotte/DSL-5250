# DSL-5250

A DSL for interacting with **IBM Access Client Solutions 5250 Emulator** for **Windows**.


## Purpose
This project was used to reinforce my limited knowledge of Groovy and learn how to make a Domain Specific Language (DSL).
Additionally, this could also be used in a basic application to automate a repetitive task in a 5250 emulator session.
